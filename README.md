coursier-channel-amm
===

A channel intending to provide various explicit versions of Ammonite, should you need easy access to an older version. Expected usage during development will be something like:

```bash
cs launch --default-channels=false --channel ./coursier-channel-amm ammonite-2.12.12
```
